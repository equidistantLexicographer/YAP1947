PREFACE
<p align="justify">
There have now been five years in which this author has steadily translated the entire New Testament into our Cebuano Visayan. And so as to realize a commensurate translation in the product of our poverty which strongly befits the Word of God, not only did it require the information as to the book to be translated, but also the unique understanding as to our Cebuano language. Thus, one of the great duties of the translator is the constant study of the Visayan Tongue, the acquisition of the actual meaning of the various parts of our lexicon.

“What is the actual meaning of Cebuano words? Of the tenses of our language?” “How are two languages to be made to correspond?” even until “How is Cebuano to be written?” These and yet more to be solved require a good study. We have dictionaries and grammars of Visayan, yet they are not enough. We will but see this in the following titles; whose intent is the giving of information as to a few things of this engrossing language of ours. They are writings which are the fruit of steady study.

In other words, the intent of these writings is the proving and illustrating that our language has systematic methods in the formulation of words—rules which are in accordance with proper thought and orderly composition. That is to say, we have a good grammar.

I am aware that there are persons who believe that we have no grammar, that our speech has no orderly rules, should it even have rules. As for their statements, these writings may give a slight elucidation.

By way of respect, it behooves one to inform everyone that the first to suggest to and hint to the author as to these matters, is his truly knowledgeable and dear teacher in the University of San Tomas in Manila, M.R.P. Dr. Candido Fernandez, O.P..
